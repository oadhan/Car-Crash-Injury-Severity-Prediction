*Contributors:* Oviya Adhan, Nory Arroyo, Caitlin Gainey, Christine Sako

*Premise:* With the rise of automated driving technologies, understanding factors influencing crash injury severity proves vital for safer road integration. This work aims to support the development of predictive safety tools to inform future automated vehicle systems and infrastructure planning. Using California car crash data from the California Crash Reporting System (CCRS), available from the California Open Data Portal (https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ccrs), our team built and trained varying machine learning models and compared their ability to predict injury severity levels based on vehicle, road, and involved party information, focusing on improving the detection of fatal outcomes. 

*Methodology:* Using Pythonâ€™s Scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries, we compared multiple supervised learning algorithms (Multiclass Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to predict crash injury severity. 
* Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing 
* Exploratory Data Visualization
* Model Development
* Model Evaluation (Macro-averaged F1-score,  â€˜Fatalâ€™ class F1-score, and accuracy)

*Tools:* Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciKit Learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Altair)
